                <p class="lead"> Israel Keyes wasn't your typical Serial killer. He didn't have a victim type like a lot of killers, e.g  Albert Fish who targeted young children, or Ed Kemper who targetted young attractive female Co Ed's. Israel Keyes murdered without discrimination. His wasn't fuelled by the type of victim, but instead, by the likelihood of success and his own self preservation. He didn't waste time choosing the right profile of a person but instead focused his mind on the act of killing in general. It didn't matter who, it didn't even matter where, his goal was to kill as many people as he could without getting caught.
<br><br>
Another thing which sets Israel Keyes apart from his contemporaries was where he chose to commit these murders. Most killers operate within a 50 mile radius of their home, and stick to places that they know. Usually a killer will hunt, murder and dispose of their victims within this radius, but Israel Keyes was different.
<br><br>
Keyes would often abduct his victim in one state, then drive into another state and murder them there, and then travel to a third location to dispose of the body. He would hide " Murder Kits" in hidden cashes in different locations around his home country of the United States and he would then fly to one city, rent a car, then drive to the location where his Murder kit was located and then drive sometimes hundreds of miles in order to actually carry out his attack.
<br><br>
Although Israel Keyes has only 3 confirmed kills, he has admitted to at least 4 murders in Washington and one in New York State, though he didn't offer up much information to police concerning these murders. It is also very possible that he killed many more people and could possibly be involved in missing persons cases a all over the country as he was operating from 2000 until 2012 when he was finally arrested for the Murder of 18 year old Samantha Koenig in his home state of Alaska.
<br><br>
Once arrested and in custody, Keyes offered no further information about his crimes, and only seemed to tease authorities with little details, and if you watch those interrogations, you can see how much he revelled in the knowledge he held back.
<br><br>
Keyes would eventually go on to commit suicide in his jail cell on December 1st 2012 before he could stand trial. like others before him, he chose his own fate in the end, a decision he shared with serial killers such Dr Harold Shipman and Fred West, who both also killed themselves in prison before they could stand trial.
<br><br>
There is much more information regarding this case, which can be found online, in documentaries and on various True crime podcasts. If you have any thoughts, or opinions, please feel free to discuss them in the comment section below.
<br><br>
I will leave you with this quote from Israel Keyes suicide letter...
<br><br>
"Okay, talk is over, words are placid and weak. Back it with action or it all comes off cheap. Watch close while I work now, feel the electric shock of my touch, open your trembling flower, or your petals I'll crush.".</p>
